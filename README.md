# Neuron-spike-sorting

There are several spikes within the recordings that
represent extracellular action potentials from five different types of neurone. The algorithm developed should
be able to detect the spikes within the signal, and determine which type of neurone produces the spike (Type
1, 2, 3, 4 or 5).
The algorithms will be tested and optimised using the given recordings and, finally, challenged using a
different and more complex dataset with more noise.
